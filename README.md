# Module 18 Challenge: Student Loan Repayment Prediction

This file is part of a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of student loan repayment using historical data provided by a CSV file. The project involves the following key tasks:

1. **Data Preparation**: Preprocessing the dataset using Pandas and scikit-learn to create features and target datasets, split them into training/testing sets, and scale the data for use in a neural network model.

2. **Model Creation and Evaluation**: Building, compiling, and training a deep neural network using TensorFlow's Keras library to predict a borrower's credit ranking based on provided features. The model is evaluated for accuracy and loss.

3. **Prediction**: Reloading the trained model to make predictions on unseen test data, converting probabilities into binary predictions, and generating a classification report to assess performance.

4. **Recommendation System Discussion**: Proposing a framework for a recommendation system to match students with appropriate loan options, including identifying relevant data, choosing a filtering method, and addressing real-world challenges.

The project showcases the use of machine learning and neural networks to tackle real-world financial prediction problems and explores how such models can aid in creating practical solutions, like personalized loan recommendations.
